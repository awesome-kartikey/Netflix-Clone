# Netflix-Clone
 We are creating a Netflix Clone using React JS with Tailwind CSS and Firebase as our backend server - A Front End Web Developer Project by Code Commerce

Build a project in React JS that will get you a job as a front-end web developer. I want to give you an example of a project idea you can list on your portfolio if you are trying to get hired as a Jr. front-end web developer.

In this project follow along with me as I build a front-end Netflix clone with a Firebase back-end! We use the TMDB(The Movie Database) API for all of the data AND we will be using Firebase Authentication to give login functionality. We will be able to store user specific data with a React front-end and a Firebase back-end. We use Firestore which is cloud storage with Firebase to save data. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - an incredible CSS framework to save time styling your apps. At the end of the build we deploy this LIVE with Firebase hosting. Thank you for watching!
